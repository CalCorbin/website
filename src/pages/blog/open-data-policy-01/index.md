The launch was a step forward to implementing the recommendations of Mayor Dewey Bartlett's Executive Order 2015-07, authored in part by City Councilor G.T. Bynum and Code for Tulsa volunteers Luke Crouch and Carlos Moreno."

The Sunlight Foundation and our partners at the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University ([https://govex.jhu.edu/](GovEx)) continue to accelerate the municipal open data movement through our participation in the [https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/](What Works Cities) initiative. Sunlight has supported local governments in the development of meaningful and sustainable open data policies, and since the launch of the What Works Cities program in August, six cities committed to the use of data and evidence have adopted new open data policies, now including Tulsa, Okla., where City Manager Jim Twombly, acting on behalf of Mayor Dewey Bartlett, Jr., signed [https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/1782/2015-07.pdf](Executive Order 2015-07) ***“Providing for an Open Data Program to Provide Public Availability, Accessibility, and Government Transparency; and Creating an Open Data Advisory Board.”***

The executive order and the accompanying [https://www.cityoftulsa.org/media/1676/open-data-advisory-board-2016.pdf](Open Data Advisory Board Charter) are now available on the [https://www.cityoftulsa.org/opentulsa](Open Tulsa website).
