## General Information
- As of the beginning of 2022, the Code for Tulsa website had not been updated in 6 years. This is an effort to modernize the core site,
and create an dynamic working environment that facilitates additional contributions from future volunteers. The Code for Tulsa website should
be a beacon to any in search of civic engagement and industry volunteer opportunities within the greater Tulsa area. To that end, the initial 
website will contain a blog, event and contact information, as well as avenues to get involved with the organization.


## Technologies Used
- GatsbyJS 4 : [Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs)
- Tailwind CSS : [Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)


## Features
- Blog (in progress)
- Front Page (in progress)
- About Page (in progress)


## Contribute
	### Developers
Additional features beyond the weblog and static site should be documented and proposed in a new directory pushed to the /dev branch.
Feature proposals should include the proposed functionality, purpose, a timeline for development, and list any additional Gatsby plugins needed 
(or external technologies required). It is encouraged that you familiarize yourself with the [Gatsby 4 documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs).

	### Designers
Designers contributing to static site updates or stand-alone event pages should read the [Design Documentation] <!-- link forthcoming -->.
Stand-alone pages should be initially pushed as a link to a figma; CSS adjustments and other design contributions can be pushed directly 
to the relevant /src directories on the /dev branch. Potential contributors should understand the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) framework and how Gatsby [handles CSS and templating](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/).

	### Writers
Blog post contributors must format their posts using [Markdown](https://ghost.org/changelog/markdown/) and upload them in a folder 
along with any media included within the blog to the [/content/blog](https://github.com/codefortulsa/website/tree/main/content/blog) directory. 
Blog posts should likewise be pushed to the /dev branch for staging.


## Setup
- All contributing designers and developers should ensure their local environment [has Gastby installed](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#installation-guide). 
- Clone into the /dev branch locally, either using the Github Desktop GUI or the CLI as below.
``` git clone -b dev https://github.com/codefortulsa/website.git ```
- To run tests and view your local edits, navigate into the site's local directory and let Gatsby do the work:
``` cd */website/
 gatsby develop ```
- All initial contributions should be pushed to the /dev branch for review. Commit messages should follow best practices 
and highlight additions and edits made within each push.
